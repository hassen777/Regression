[Regression_Module_Overview_DS.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21087524/Regression_Module_Overview_DS.pdf)
In this module, we delve into the realm of regression analysis, covering essential techniques and methodologies crucial
for predictive modelling and data-driven decision-making. We start by exploring fundamental concepts such as linear
regression and model performance evaluation, gradually progressing to more advanced topics like multiple linear
regression, variable selection, regularisation, ensemble methods, and bootstrapping.

Throughout the module, we'll engage in examples and practical assessments to reinforce our understanding and
application of regression analysis techniques in realistic scenarios. By using real-world datasets and examples, we'll
contextualise the concepts and demonstrate their practical relevance in solving complex problems.
